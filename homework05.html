      You are to write an MPI program which is able to multiply a row vector
      and a matrix.  The vector can be thought of as a <var>1×M</var>
      matrix—i.w., a single row.  The matrix should be
      an <var>M×N</var> matrix (<var>M</var> rows, <var>N</var> columns)
      where <var>M</var> is <em>divisible by</em> the number of processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you multiply these together, you will get an <var>1×N</var>
      matrix—i.e., a row vector with as many columns as the matrix.
      Each column in the answer is calculated as the dot product of the
      corresponding column in the matrix with the vector.  As an example,
      consider the following multiplication.  Note that in this
      example, <var>M</var> is 3 and <var>N</var> is 4.

    <p>
      Your program should begin by reading <var>M</var> and <var>N</var>, the
      number of rows and columns.  (As mentioned above, we will assume
      that <var>N</var> is divisible by the number of processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next <var>M</var> numbers should be the vector.  After that should
      be <var>M×N</var> numbers representing the matrix in row-major
      order.  In the example above, our program would need to be run with one,
      two, or four processes, and the input would be as follows:
    </p>
    <pre class="example">3 4 1 -1 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
</pre>
    <p>
      Note that your program should not care about spacing in the input; it
      should just read in numbers.  Thus, the input above could be better
      formatted like so:
    </p>
    <pre class="example">3

1 -1 2

1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9 10 11 12
</pre>
    <p>
      Your main process should read in the input,
      broadcast <var>M</var>, <var>N</var>, and the vector, then scatter the
      columns matrix.  (Broadcast both <var>M</var> and <var>N</var> in a
      single packed broadcast.)  Each process should calculate the dot product
      of each of its columns with the vector.  Then gather the results back
      into a vector in the main process.  The main process should print the
      resulting matrix out—all on one line separated by spaces (like a
      column vector).  In the example above, the output would be
    </p>
    <pre class="example">14 16 18 20
</pre>
    <p>
      I also want you to turn in three input/output test cases that
      demonstrate the correctness of your student.  Please format your test
      cases as the second one above so that they are easy to read.  qIn none
      of your test cases should <var>M</var> = 1 or <var>N</var> = 1.  (That's
      a good thing to test, but I want to see three more complicated test
      cases.)  At least one of these should use 64 processes.  You may want to
      use a script to generate these data files as they will be fairly large.
